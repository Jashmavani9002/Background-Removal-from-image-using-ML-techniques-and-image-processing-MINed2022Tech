Background Removal from image using ML techniques and image processing

# In this repo two methods are described
- using deeplabv3+ model (Transfer learning)
- remgb library 

<p>
Image segmentation has helped to solve a variety of difficult problems. One such problem is separating the diamond from the image. We have over 2.3 million images in our dataset that contain diamonds at various angles. The shiny reflecting cuts of the diamond, as well as the shadow beneath it, make this a difficult but fascinating problem to solve. Dataset : - In the dataset there will be 14 folders each named with the SHAPE-label of diamond. - There are a total 9135 uniquely numbered diamonds each having 256 images captured at different angles.
